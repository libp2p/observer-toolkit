# libp2p-introspection-ui

User interface for visualising libp2p introspection data.

This [Lerna monorepo](https://github.com/lerna/lerna), managed with [Yarn Workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/).

The packages, which will (TBC) be published to NPM under a namespace allowing them to be installed and used individually (e.g. `npm i @libp2p-introspection-ui/sdk`), comprise of:

- [**`packages/sdk`**](tree/master/packages/sdk): _Status: needs extending, adding [filtering (WIP)](https://github.com/nearform/libp2p-introspection-ui/pull/4), more data structures, more base components including chart types and more input elements, and design improvements needed to the Timeline_. A Software Development Kit for building React components that consume and visualise LibP2P introspection data:
  - [`/components`](tree/master/packages/sdk/components): Base components which can be built on and extended. [**SDK components documentation**](docs/sdk/components/index.md)
  - [`/hooks`](tree/master/packages/sdk/hooks): Custom React Hooks for managing, formatting and manipulating LibP2P introspection data ready for consumption by components. [**SDK hooks documentation**](docs/sdk/hooks/index.md)
  - [`DataProvider`](tree/master/packages/sdk/components/DataProvider) contexts using [`useContext`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecontext) allowing data and user choices to be cleanly shared between components
  - Theming using [`styled-components`](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) and a `useContext` [`ThemeProvider`](tree/master/packages/sdk/components/DataProvider) allowing new components to easily share consistent styling

- [**`packages/proto`**](tree/master/packages/proto): _Status: mostly complete, needing testing and tweaks_. NodeJS scripts for working with LibP2P introspection data in [`protobuf` (Protocol Buffer)](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) format:
  - [`/mock`](tree/master/packages/proto/mock): Scripts for simulating a LibP2P network, generating data files representing plausible network activity observed by a mock LibP2P node.
  - [`/protobuf`](tree/master/packages/proto/protobuf): Original `.proto` protobuf definition, with JavaScript parser and encoder generated by `protoc`.
  - [`/utils`](tree/master/packages/proto/utils) including helper functions and definitions to ease working with decoded LibP2P introspection data in JavaScript

- [**`packages/catalogue`**](tree/master/packages/catalogue): _Status: needs [initial implementation (WIP)](https://github.com/nearform/libp2p-introspection-ui/pull/3), then design and feature improvements_ A React app, deployable locally and to GitHub Pages, displaying a browsable catalogue of whitelisted React components built on the LibP2P Introspection UI SDK, and wiring these in to a data file upload, a websocket to a live LibP2P node, or to provided sample data sets.
  - [`/src`](tree/master/packages/catalogue/src): The React app, built on this SDK, Create React App and craco for customised config
  - [`/src/definitions/approvedViz.js`](tree/master/packages/catalogue/src/definitions/approvedViz.js): The whitelist of approved components. [**Community contributions are welcome!**]()

And several example components built on the SDK:

- [**`packages/connections-table`**](tree/master/packages/connections-table) _Status: needs design improvements and additional features including filtering, sparklines and streams subtable_. An interactive data table showing the connections observed at a user-selected point in time, including cumulative traffic, peer Ids, connection status and transports.
- Streams visualisation TBC
- DHT visualisation TBC
- Additional visualisation TBC
