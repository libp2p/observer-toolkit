# libp2p-introspection-ui SDK components

All LibP2P Introspection UI components are rendered exclusively using React functional components. D3 is used, but only for data processing and generating props, which are passed to React components that render HTML or SVG as appropriate. All DOM manipulation is handled by React.

_WIP, TBC after refactoring Timeline component to fit new structure._
